# eosdactoolkit

## Purpose
This is the member client where the DAC members will interface with the deployed smart contract code. The code is written in javascript using Vue.js and Quasar-framework.js.

## Pre-Requisites
You want to be able to read javascript code and have a basic understanding of frontend web development. If you want to simply change the assets to your DAC's messaging, branding, and images then the process is not too difficult.
## This folder needs to be populated

## Add language strings
Add the default language strings to the project. You can use your own repo too. Don't forget the "." after the git url.
```bash
